# Palindrome check

A palindrome is a word, phrase or series of words that reads the same backwards and forwards. Example: _"kayak"_ is a palindrom, _"hello"_ is not a palindrom.
    
**Part A:**
- Write a function to check if a string is a palyndrome.
- The check should take place directly during input. Use reactive forms (preferred) or template driven forms (only when using signals). Do not bind native DOM events.
- Show a text _"Yes, it is a palindrome"_ or _"No, it is not a palindrome"_

**Part B:**
- Provide some suggestions while typing (see `suggestion.service.ts`).
- We do not want the api is called too often.
- In case of error display the error message.
